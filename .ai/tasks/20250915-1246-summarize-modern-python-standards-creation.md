# Task: Summarize the work of creating the modern-python-project-standards.md file

## Date

## Prompt
Task: Please summarize the work of creating the `modern-python-project-standards.md` file.

## Context
The user requested a summary of the work done to create the modern Python project standards document. This work involved analyzing existing repositories, reviewing current standards, and creating updated documentation reflecting modern best practices used in production repositories like bff-auth.

## Actions Taken
1. Analyzed the existing `cloud-team-python-project-standards.md` document (v2.0.0 from 2024-12-29)
2. Reviewed the bff-auth repository as the reference implementation of modern standards
3. Examined 4 Python repositories for compliance patterns:
   - bff-auth (100% compliant - reference implementation)
   - cloud-engine-cdk
   - ld-data-models
   - operational-ingest
4. Identified key modernization changes:
   - Migration from Flake8/Black to Ruff
   - Update from Python 3.12 to 3.13
   - Update from Poetry 1.x to 2.1+
   - Addition of AI-assisted development tracking
5. Created initial CLAUDE.md file for the AA-bff-auth repository
6. Renamed document from `cloud-team-python-project-standards-revised.md` to `modern-python-project-standards.md`
7. Updated document title and purpose to reflect multi-team usage
8. Moved AI-assisted development content to Appendix A (optional)
9. Removed Appendix B migration guide (already completed by team)
10. Fixed markdown formatting issues throughout document

## Files Changed
- `CLAUDE.md` - Created initial AI instructions file
- `cloud-team-python-project-standards-revised.md` - Created revised standards document
- `modern-python-project-standards.md` - Renamed and finalized standards document
- Deleted intermediate file: `cloud-team-python-project-standards-revised.md`

## Testing
- Validated markdown formatting
- Cross-referenced with actual bff-auth implementation
- Verified all code examples and configuration snippets
- Confirmed alignment with centralized GitHub workflows

## Outcome
Successfully created a comprehensive Modern Python Project Standards document (v3.0.0) that:
- Reflects current production practices from bff-auth repository
- Provides clear, actionable standards for Python 3.13, Poetry 2.1+, and Ruff
- Includes optional AI-assisted development guidelines
- Serves multiple teams working on cloud-native Python applications
- Removes outdated tooling (Flake8/Black) in favor of modern alternatives (Ruff)

The document now serves as the authoritative guide for modern Python development practices across teams.

## Notes
- The bff-auth repository achieved 100% compliance and serves as the reference implementation
- Three other repositories need minor updates (mainly migrating from Flake8 to Ruff)
- The document evolved from being "cloud team" specific to serving all teams doing modern Python development
- AI-assisted development was appropriately moved to an optional appendix since not all teams use it
