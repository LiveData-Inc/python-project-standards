# Task: Consolidate documentation

## Date
20250915-1348

## Prompt
Task: Consolidate documentation to ensure that the top-level README contains the project information, and that all docs about the python `check_standards.py` are under the docs/folder with correct links from the top-level README.

Additional request during task: Task: rename the check_standards.py` script to check_python_project_standards.py

## Context
The user wanted to reorganize the project documentation to have a cleaner structure with:
- A comprehensive top-level README with project overview
- All detailed documentation moved to the docs/ folder
- The compliance checker script renamed for clarity
- All internal links updated to reflect the new structure

## Actions Taken
1. Analyzed current documentation structure to understand what needed to be moved
2. Created docs/compliance-checker/ subdirectory for compliance checker documentation
3. Renamed src/compliance_checker/check_standards.py to check_python_project_standards.py
4. Updated src/compliance_checker/__init__.py to import from the renamed module
5. Updated batch_checker.sh to reference the new script name
6. Moved README_compliance_checker.md to docs/compliance-checker/README.md
7. Moved UNATTENDED_SETUP.md to docs/compliance-checker/UNATTENDED_SETUP.md
8. Moved python-project-standards.md to docs/python-project-standards.md
9. Moved cloud-team-python-project-standards.md to docs/cloud-team-python-project-standards.md
10. Created comprehensive new top-level README.md with project overview and links to all documentation
11. Updated all references to the old script name in documentation files
12. Fixed references in .github/workflows/nightly-compliance-check.yml
13. Updated pyproject.toml sonar exclusions
14. Updated .sonarcloud.properties exclusions

## Files Changed
- `src/compliance_checker/check_standards.py` → `src/compliance_checker/check_python_project_standards.py` - Renamed script
- `src/compliance_checker/__init__.py` - Updated imports to new script name
- `src/compliance_checker/batch_checker.sh` - Updated script reference
- `README_compliance_checker.md` → `docs/compliance-checker/README.md` - Moved and updated paths
- `UNATTENDED_SETUP.md` → `docs/compliance-checker/UNATTENDED_SETUP.md` - Moved and updated paths
- `python-project-standards.md` → `docs/python-project-standards.md` - Moved to docs
- `cloud-team-python-project-standards.md` → `docs/cloud-team-python-project-standards.md` - Moved to docs
- `README.md` - Completely rewritten with comprehensive project information
- `.github/workflows/nightly-compliance-check.yml` - Updated repository and script references
- `pyproject.toml` - Updated sonar exclusions
- `.sonarcloud.properties` - Updated sonar exclusions

## Testing
Documentation changes and file reorganization. No code functionality changed except for renaming and import updates.

## Outcome
Successfully consolidated all documentation with:
- Clear top-level README with project overview
- All detailed documentation organized under docs/ folder
- Compliance checker script renamed to check_python_project_standards.py
- All internal references and links updated
- Cleaner, more maintainable project structure

## Notes
The reorganization makes the project structure more professional and easier to navigate. The renamed script (check_python_project_standards.py) better reflects its purpose. All documentation is now properly organized with the compliance checker having its own subdirectory under docs/.
